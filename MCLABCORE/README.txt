In the "McLabCore" project (https://github.com/Sable/mclab-core), the following files were modified or added:

- natlab.ast (modified)
- natlabModifications.jadd (added)
- natlabRelativeChildIndex.jadd (added)
- natlabTryStmtCatchPartComments.jadd (added)
- AST2XML.jrag (modified)

The modifications and additions are backwards compatible to the best of my knowledge.

The new McLabCore.jar so generated is a dependency of this project. It can be found in the "lib" folder.
